# Construct

A medium-sized 1.18.2 pack of carefully selected mods for a more interesting modded experience. Focused around Create and Tinker's with some nice vanilla+ improvements around world generation, bugfixes, QoL improvements, and mobs.

## The World

The Overworld generation Oh The Biomes You'll Go (BYG) and Terralith are the most notable changes to world generation resulting in more biome variety and interesting generation. There are a number of new structures from Repurposed Structures and YUNG's series with added compatibility between the two.

The Nether is extended by BYG and Infernal Expansion keeping things interesting but not being frustratingly difficult. The End has more biomes thanks to BYG, but isn't fundamentally changed due to a lack of 1.18 End mods.

Alex's Mobs, Naturalist, Ecologics, and more ensure that all the new biomes are populated and lively.

## Automation and Storage

Create and Tinker's Construct are versatility yet complex. Resulting in automation that takes a bit more thought than connecting a bunch of machines with pipes and wires.

Sophisticated Backpacks/Storage and Storage Drawers allow for effective storage of bulk items.

## Food

Farmer's Delight (+ expansions), Neapolitan, Create Cafe, and more add a bunch of foods that could be interesting to make some factories around.

## Building

Absent by Design, Comforts, Decorative Blocks, and Twigs as well as the world generation mods add a ton of new blocks for the foundation of your homes and factories.

## Fixes, QoL Improvements, Enhancements, Etc.

A number of performance and bugfixes allow for more fps and a more stable modded experience thean otherwise possible. QoL improvements make it harder for your pets to die and removes general vanilla Minecraft annoyances.
